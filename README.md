# Time of Flight Analysis Project for SiPM Array using Root Cern, Tel Aviv University

## convert.C
This file allows for manipulation of the .csv files produced by the Teledyne Lecroy Waverunner 8404M Oscilliscope. The code converts the .csv to a .txt file, deletes all unnecessary lines, and properly formats the values in both columns for use by Root Cern.  

Usage:
* Change the upper bound of the for loop to match the number of the last event taken.
* Within the for loop, change the "C4" value of the variable "channel" to match the channel number used, ie. C3.

Notes:
* The code deletes the .csv files as it converts them to .txt, so ensure files are backed up before running the code.
* The code only converts one channel at a time. Since there are two channels used for the project, you must run the code once, change the string channel variable, and then run it again.
* If you run the code twice on the same channel, it will produce empty .txt files. Ensure that you only run the code once on each set of files.

## plotter.C
This file allows you to visualize an event by graphing a peak from each channel side by side.  

Usage:
* Change the g and z variable source files to align with the channel and file numbers you want to visualize.
* To update the graph titles, change the g -> SetTitle and z -> SetTitle lines.

## time_diff.C
This file allows you to plot a histogram of time diffferences for specified events. The code calculates the time difference by subtracting the time it takes one graph of an event to reach a percentage of the peak from the time it takes for the other graph to reach the same percentage of its peak.

Usage:
* Change the upper bound of the for loop to match the number of the last event taken.
* Within the for loop, change the "C3"  and "C4" values of the variables c3 and c4 to match the channel numbers used, ie. C1 and C2.
* To update the graph title, change the second value of TH1F on line 20.
* To update axis titles, adjust line 171 and 172.
* To limit which events are added to the histogram, add if statements around line 158.
* To set the percentage of the peak at which the two graphs of an event are compared, change variable param. It is currently set at -0.4, which is 40%. 30% would be -0.3, and so on.
* To debug the code and see values for each event in a .txt file, uncomment lines 24, 25, and 162.
* If you notice pleatueas in the data, uncomment lines 147 through 153 and adjust the value to be the plateau cutoff value.
  
## skew.C
This file allows you to plot a graph that compares two characteristics of specified events. The code calculates the time difference in the same way as the time_diff.C file, and then allows you to specify what characteristics of the events to plot on each axis.

Usage:
* Change the upper bound of the for loop to match the number of the last event taken.
* Within the for loop, change the "C3"  and "C4" values of the variables c3 and c4 to match the channel numbers used, ie. C1 and C2.
* To change the characteristics that are graphed on each axis, adjust the second and third value of SetPoint in line 157.
* To limit which events are graphed, add if statements around line 157 and 158.
* To update the graph title and axis labels, change the m -> SetTitle on line 169.
* To set the percentage of the peak at which the two graphs of an event are compared, change variable param. It is currently set at -0.4, which is 40%. 30% would be -0.3, and so on.
* To debug the code and see values for each event in a .txt file, uncomment lines 22, 23, and 161.
* If you notice pleatueas in the data, uncomment lines 145 through 152 and adjust the value to be the plateau cutoff value.
